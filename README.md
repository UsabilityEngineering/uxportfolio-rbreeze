Hi, I'm [Remington Breeze](https://breeze.software). I am a Computer Science major. 

In my free time, I like to run, build websites, read, draw, and play video games. 

I've always been interested in design in general but have not studied much UX design. I love building things that are satisfying and easy to use and am excited to learn more about this process. Further, I'm interested in HCI because the most [innovative pieces of technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos) usually place a strong emphasis on usability.
